## ReID_Using_DensePose

This is a master thesis by Anton Fredriksson and Bj√∂rn Elwin at Axis Communications.

We want to improve Re-ID algorithms using Facebook AI's DensePose

# Setup

Detectron2 and DensePose needs to be downloaded to use the functions for creating Texture maps.

The git to detectron2 is found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)  and the installationguide is [here](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html) 

Denspose is found within the Detectron2 repository at Detectron2/projects/Densepose and an installation guide for the package is foun at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/projects/DensePose/doc/GETTING_STARTED.md)
